# notestorage

**A simple note storing app with a pinch of hive and bloc ;)**

## Getting Started

Inside _NoteBloc_ class there's method  __mapAddNoteEventToStateWithMockedResponse()_ with mocked response, where error or success can occur randomly. It's made for purpose of showing _FloatingSaveButton_ different behavior for each state (loading, error, success).
